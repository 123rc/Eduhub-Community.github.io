Gradient Boosting is a popular boosting algorithm. In gradient boosting, each predictor corrects its predecessorâ€™s error. In contrast to Adaboost, the weights of the training instances are not tweaked, instead, each predictor is trained using the residual errors of predecessor as labels.

There is a technique called the Gradient Boosted Trees whose base learner is CART (Classification and Regression Trees).
he ensemble consists of N trees. Tree1 is trained using the feature matrix X and the labels y. The predictions labelled y1(hat) are used to determine the training set residual errors r1. Tree2 is then trained using the feature matrix X and the residual errors r1 of Tree1 as labels. The predicted results r1(hat) are then used to determine the residual r2. The process is repeated until all the N trees forming the ensemble are trained
